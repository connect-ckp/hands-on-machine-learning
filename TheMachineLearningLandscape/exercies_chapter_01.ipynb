    "# How would you define machine learning?\n",
    "An automated way to find generalized rules based on a large amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can you name four types of problems where it shines?\n",
    "* when the problem consists of a large number of rules\n",
    "* in case of a complex problem with no good solution\n",
    "* in case of fluctuating environment because ML model can adapt to changes\n",

    "# What is a labeled training set?\n",
    "A training set which can be used for supervised learning. The label (dependent variable) is the value which should be predicted by the model using given features (independent variables).\n",

    "# What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?\n",
    "An algorithm based on reinforcement learning, because the problem cannot be described as one of the problems solved by unsupervised learning and it is not possible to created a labeled dataset.\n",

    "Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "# Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "Supervised learning - the training set is labeled (spam/not spam)\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is an online learning system?\n",
    "A learning system which can be trained incrementally. It can quickly adapt to changes because the model does not need to be trained from scratch every time a new observation is added to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is out-of-core learning?\n",
    "Learning when the data does not fit in memory. It is an example of online learning.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Load a batch into memory\n",
    "2. Train the model\n",
    "3. Discard the batch and return to step 1\n",

    "Instance-based learning\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm hyperparameter?\n",
    "model parameter - the value produced by the learning algorithm, describes the model\n",
    "hyperparameter - a value used to configure the learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "# What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?\n",
    "Model-based learning algorithm searches for the parameters which miminalize the cost function. \n",

    "# Can you name four of the main challanges in Machine Learning?\n",
    "* not enough data\n",
    "* poor quality data\n",
    "* non representative data\n",
    "* irrelevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "# If your model performs great on the trainign data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?\n",
    "Overfitting, the model has been trained to work perfectly when applied to the test set.\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "* reduce noise in the training data\n",
    "* gather more data\n",
    "* simplify the model\n",
    "  * use a model which has fewer parameters\n",
    "  * reduce the number of features in the training set\n",
    "  * constrain the model (regularization)\n",

    "# What is a test set and why would you want to use it?\n",
    "It is the part of the available data which is used to evaluate the performance of the model.\n",
    "//TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the purpose of a validation set?\n",
    "Validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. Test set cannot be used for that purpose in order to avoid overfitting.\n",

    "# What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?\n",
    "Overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?\n",
    "Steps of cross-validation\n",
    "1. Dividing the available data into training set and test set.\n",
    "2. The training set is divided into subsets.\n",
    "3. One of the subsets is used as a validation set, the others are used for training.\n",
    "4. The subsets may be used in multiple combinations.\n",
    "5. The test set is still used to evaluate the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is prefered because the whole training set is used for training (but not at the same time). If a separate validation set is used, the training set is smaller, so cross-validation is a method to avoid \"wasting\" data. "
